# non-negative-integer

A Node JS Express application that reads the user input (number) and checks to see if its a non-negative integer or not.
A docker image for this is available here - [https://hub.docker.com/r/zeemarsh/non-negative-integer](https://hub.docker.com/r/zeemarsh/non-negative-integer)

## Why Node JS?

Because of how light weight this application is - this tech stack feels like the ideal approach for running a lightweight container.

## Installation

`npm install` will install all the required node_modules

`node index.js` will run the application on port `80`
